> [!NOTE]
> **JRTI is a tech demo as much as it is a mod - an experiment to see how far KSP can be pushed.**
>
> The mod is stable and usable, but expect a few unpolished edges. You may still encounter bugs, performance issues, or missing features. If you do, please report them in the Issues tab with your log file attached. Prefixing the title with `Bug:` helps with triage.

>[!WARNING]
> Mac OS has limited compatibility, the mod may not function properly. This is still being looked into.

## Overview

**Just Read The Instructions** (**JRTI**) is a mod for **Kerbal Space Program** that lets you view your **Hullcam VDS** camera feeds in a web browser, in the spirit of **OCISLY**.

## Requirements

* **Kerbal Space Program** `1.12.x`
* **[HullcamVDS-Continued](https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/HullcamVDSContinued)** (latest version)

## Features

* View **Hullcam VDS** camera feeds in a web browser
* Externalize in-game camera views outside the main game window
* Record camera feeds from the web UI (locally on the KSP host, or Save-As on remote clients)
* Grab the raw MJPEG feed URL for OBS or other external tools

## Installation

**Via CKAN:** Search for `JustReadTheInstructions` in [CKAN](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN) and install it from there.

**Via SpaceDock:** Download from the [SpaceDock page](https://spacedock.info/mod/4212/Just%20Read%20The%20Instructions) and follow the manual install steps below.

**Via GitHub:** Download the latest release ZIP from the [Releases page](https://github.com/RELMYMathieu/JustReadTheInstructions/releases), extract it, and move the `JustReadTheInstructions` folder into your KSP `GameData` folder.

Your final install should look like this:

```text
Kerbal Space Program/
└── GameData/
    └── JustReadTheInstructions/
```

## Customization

The **Loss of Signal** image shown in the web UI when a camera feed is unavailable can be customized with any PNG of your choice (recommended: `1920×1080`).

Add this file:
```text
GameData/JustReadTheInstructions/Web/images/customlos.png
```

If `customlos.png` is not present, JRTI automatically falls back to the built-in:
```text
GameData/JustReadTheInstructions/Web/images/los.png
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Editing files in the `Web` folder is not supported and may break the mod's functionality.

## Known Issues

A few known issues are tracked but not yet fixed:

* **Firefox recording output is unreliable.** The recorded file may be corrupt or unplayable. Use Chrome or Edge for recording until this is resolved.
* **Stale zero-byte buffer files** are sometimes left in the recordings folder after a session ends. They are safe to delete manually.
* **macOS is not properly supported.** A GPU async API used internally by this Unity version is unavailable on macOS, a legacy quirk inherited from KSP's Unity build. A fix is being investigated.
* **Performance degradation with Parallax.** Parallax integration is disabled by default. Enabling it in the Settings menu may cause significant frame-rate drops.
* **Odd reflection/shadow artifact on planets.** With Scatterer and/or EVE installed, looking at Kerbin or the Mun through a JRTI camera can show a secondary reflection or shadow not present on the main camera. Appears to be a probe or hook tied to the main camera's frustum bleeding into the mod camera. Under investigation.

## For Developers

### Prerequisites

* Visual Studio 2022, or MSBuild 17+
* Kerbal Space Program `1.12.x`
* [HullcamVDS-Continued](https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/HullcamVDSContinued) installed in your KSP `GameData`

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `KSPPath.props.example` to `KSPPath.props` at the repository root
3. Set `<KSPPath>` to your KSP install directory
4. If HullcamVDS is at a non-standard path, also override `<HullcamVDSPath>`

```xml
<Project ToolsVersion="12.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <KSPPath>C:\Your\KSP\Install</KSPPath>
    <!-- Optional: only if HullcamVDS isn't at GameData\HullCameraVDS\Plugins\ -->
    <!-- <HullcamVDSPath>C:\Your\KSP\Install\GameData\HullCameraVDS\Plugins\HullcamVDSContinued.dll</HullcamVDSPath> -->
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

> `KSPPath.props` is gitignored and will never be committed.

### Building

Open `JustReadTheInstructions.sln` in Visual Studio and build normally, or run:

```powershell
msbuild JustReadTheInstructions.sln /p:Configuration=Release
```

The built mod will be output to:

```text
JustReadTheInstructions\Distribution\GameData\JustReadTheInstructions\
```

Copy the produced `JustReadTheInstructions` folder into your KSP `GameData` to install the development build.
