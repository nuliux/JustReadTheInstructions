# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 2.0.1 - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- "Stop" button now properly turns green if a client is requesting the camera feed


## v2.0.0 Web UI Recording, Polishing, QoL and more! - 2026-04-20

### Added

- Recording is now available in this new version
- Unified **Settings & Integrations** menu merging the former Settings and Debug menus into a single scrollable window with four collapsible sections: Stream/Capture, Visual Mod Integrations, Diagnostics, and Troubleshooting
- Visual mod integrations (Deferred, TUFX, Scatterer, EVE, Parallax, Firefly) are now toggleable directly from the unified menu with live availability indicators
- **HullcamVDS Camera Filter** integration — discovers the active Hullcam filter/overlay material at runtime via reflection and blits it over the stream frame; falls back silently to raw frame when unavailable or unset
- Integration enable/disable state now persists to `settings.cfg` and is restored on launch (previously runtime-only)
- Stream All button on in-game Flight UI — streams all available cameras in one click (shown only when more than one camera is available)
- Settings button on in-game Flight UI — opens the unified settings menu directly from the flight toolbar window
- Custom LOS screen support (drop `customlos.png` alongside `los.png` to override)
- `GET /session` endpoint returning a per-launch UUID, used by the web client to detect a fresh game session
- Troubleshooting section in the unified menu documenting when a camera or feed reload is needed, with a one-click "Reload Integrations" button

### Fixed

- Persisted offline/destroyed camera cards from a previous game launch are now cleared on page load when a new game session is detected — the web client compares the stored session UUID against the server's and wipes `localStorage` on mismatch
- Firefox integration now properly allows recording (however, not constantly reliable, see known issues)

### Changed

- Integration enable flags moved from `JRTIDebugMenu` (runtime-only statics) to `JRTISettings` (persisted properties) — **Parallax still defaults to `false`**
- `JRTIDebugMenu` removed; all functionality absorbed into the unified `JRTISettingsGUI`
- Ctrl+Alt+F8 (former debug menu) and Ctrl+Alt+F9 (former settings) now both open the same unified menu

### Known Issues

- Firefox recording output is unreliable — the recorded file may be corrupt or unplayable
- Stale zero-byte buffer files are sometimes left in the recordings folder after a recording session ends
- macOS is not properly supported — a GPU async API used by this Unity version is unavailable on macOS (legacy KSP/Unity quirk); a fix is being investigated
- Performance degradation with Parallax enabled — Parallax integration is disabled by default for this reason


## v2.0.0-beta.4 Web UI Recording (Beta 4) - 2026-04-17

### Added

- Server-side SIDX (segment index) injection on MP4 finalize, enabling frame-accurate scrubbing and seeking in all recorded files without any post-processing step

### Fixed

- Pause/Resume button on recording cards stayed visible when idle — `.btn` uses `display: inline-flex`, which overrode the HTML `hidden` attribute (whose default is `display: none`). Added a single `[hidden] { display: none !important; }` rule so the attribute works as expected everywhere it's used
- Camera-card footer size label now reads `LAST RECORDING SIZE = X MB` instead of a bare byte count, and persists after the recording ends instead of clearing the moment the state flips to idle
- Accidentally hardcoded WebM as mimeType instead of accepting whichever other flag was available in the candidate list, which caused recording to fail on certain occasions
- MP4 recordings were never seekable — `FixMp4` was silently crashing on every finalize due to a 4-byte header miscalculation in the SIDX builder (`28` → `32`), causing an `IndexOutOfRangeException` that was swallowed by the outer catch
- Offline camera cards disappeared on page refresh — `localStorage` was overwritten with only the live camera list on each sync, immediately evicting any card that had just gone offline. Persistence now snapshots all cards after each sync loop completes

### Changed

- `camera-card.js` refactor for readability (no behaviour change): state-dependent UI mutations now driven by a `REC_STATES` lookup table instead of a four-branch `if/else`, DOM construction split across `_buildPreview` / `_buildInfo` / `_buildFooter`, and the three near-identical copy-button blocks replaced by `makeButton` / `makeCopyButton` helpers
- The disabled-when-unsupported record button now uses a `.btn-unsupported` CSS class instead of inline `opacity` / `pointerEvents` styles, to match the existing `.btn.watch-disabled` pattern
- Removed WebM support due to inconsistent browser support. The list of MIME types is now just MP4 variants, which should be supported widely enough for the time being
- `JRTIStreamServer` split into partial class files by concern (`Http`, `Recording`, `Mp4`, `Types`) to reduce the size of the monolith
- `FixMp4` is now self-contained — wrapped in its own try-catch that logs full exceptions with stack trace and never propagates to `FinalizeRecordingSession`

### Known Issues

- Faint reflection/shadow artifact visible on Kerbin and the Mun through JRTI cameras when Scatterer and/or EVE are installed. Actual shadows render correctly, so this looks like a hook or reflection probe tied to the main camera's frustum bleeding into the mod camera. Under investigation
- Sometimes, there will be MP4 files with a size of 0 bytes that do not get cleaned up in the recordings folder. This problem is being investigated.


## v2.0.0-beta.3 Web UI Recording (Beta 3) - 2026-04-17

### Added

- Manual pause/resume button on recording cards
- Loss-of-signal triggered pause now waits 5 s before acting — the recording is allowed to capture the LOS screen during that window

### Fixed

- Grid layout broken after live/offline section split — `#cameras` rule was orphaned; replaced with rules targeting `#cameras-live` and `#cameras-offline`
- Recording cards no longer show a double preview: the recorder canvas is now absolutely positioned and the offline overlay is explicitly hidden on mount
- Snapshot loop no longer fires immediately on every card at once after the jitter refactor; first fetch is immediate, jitter only offsets the interval start

### Changed

- LOS signal to the recorder is decoupled from the visual offline state — the recorder has its own 5 s delay independent of the overlay delay
- Paused status text no longer reads "signal lost", since pause is now also user-triggered


## v2.0.0-beta.2 Web UI Recording (Beta 2) - 2026-04-17

### Added

- Remote viewers (non-localhost) get a local Save-As dialog instead of uploading to the KSP machine
- "Copy URL" copies the viewer page link; new "Copy Raw" button copies the bare MJPEG feed URL for OBS and other external tools (with a hover tooltip)

### Fixed

- Removed `video/x-matroska;codecs=avc1` from the MIME candidate list — it is unsupported by all major browsers and was masking the correct VP9 WebM fallback on Linux
- Cameras no longer render when nobody is watching — the lazy rendering guard is now applied before `SetCamerasEnabled`, not after. Previously the GPU rendered every frame regardless of active clients
- Snapshot polling interval raised to 10 s (was 2 s) and snapshot interest window reduced to 3 s, so cameras sleep between polls rather than staying hot continuously
- Heartbeat and server-side session management are now skipped entirely for remote (local-save) recordings


## v2.0.0-beta.1 Web UI Recording (Beta 1) - 2026-04-16

### Added

- Basic recording support in the web UI (experimental)
- Recording support in the C# API


## v1.0.0 - 2026-04-15

### Added

- Initial public release
